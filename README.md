# Schrodinger's Mastermind

This is a version of the classic Mastermind game but the secret code isn't set in stone. It optimizes itself each time the player submits a guess so that the player can only win once the history of guesses logically narrows it down to one possibility.

```
git clone git@github.com:bracketdash/mastermind.git
npm install
npm start
```
