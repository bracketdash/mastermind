# Schrodinger's Mastermind

This is a version of the classic Mastermind game but the secret code isn't set in stone. It optimizes itself each time the player submits a guess so that the player can only win once the history of guesses logically narrows it down to one possibility.

To run this game locally, clone this repo and run `npm start` from the repo folder.
