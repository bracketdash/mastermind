# Schrodinger's Mastermind

This is a version of the classic Mastermind game but the secret code adapts to the player's guesses so that they can only win once the history of guesses logically narrows it down to one possibility, without being able to prove that the computer cheated.

The UI is currently a work in progress, but you should be able to run `getFeedback()` from game.js to see it in action for now.
